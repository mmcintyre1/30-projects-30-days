# 30-projects-30-days
A repo for the projects created from https://wesbos.com/javascript30/

The idea is to create one new project a day in vanilla JavaScript without using any external libraries.  Where time permitted, I expanded upon the initial ideas to enhance things, or restyle, or make a different version.
